# Archtype

A typing game for Arch Linux commands, written in Python. Test your typing speed and accuracy with over 150 real Arch Linux commands!

## How it works

This game is built using Python's `curses` library to create a terminal-based user interface. It presents you with a random Arch Linux command, and you have to type it as fast as you can. Your speed and accuracy are measured to give you a rank and a score.

### Features:

*   **150+ Arch Linux Commands:** A wide range of commands to test your knowledge.
*   **Ranking System:** Get a rank from S (Legendary!) to D (Too Slow!) based on your performance.
*   **Scoring:** Earn points for each correctly typed command and build your high score.
*   **Interactive Menus:** Pause the game, retry commands, and quit from different screens.
*   **Terminal UI:** A clean and colorful interface built with the `curses` library.
